# Engaged-UTF-8
 View and post Unicode on the WELL

This browser extension is specifically for Engaged users on The
WELL, it does nothing on any other website. It enables viewing and
posting all Unicode, overriding the Engaged server settings that
limit characters to the Windows-1252 extended ASCII character set.
It also provides an automatic translation of your text posts into
ASCII for compatibility with users who can't view Unicode. A feature
for simple posting of images is also included.

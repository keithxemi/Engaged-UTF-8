# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy provides a general overview of the collection and processing of your data.

# What kind of personal data do I collect?
No data is collected or uploaded to any server. The extension only stores the user checkbox settings locally.

# Why does the extension require these permissions?

## "webRequest" and "webRequestBlocking"
The extension works by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request response headers. Page content is then displayed to the user using requested character encodings.

## "https://user.well.com/engaged.cgi*"
The extension needs permission for the specified URLs to intercept network requests.
